# OpenAI-Agent-SDK

Agent SDK 
Diving In Source Code of Agent SDK
======================================

When Java came we know it catch success
it was a small language and people can
learn it ummm 15 - 30 days max. This same
goes for OpenAI SDK. Hopefully SDK is not
destroyed becuz Java was. Now lets not 
talk and jump to main work.
======================================

Why use the Agent SDK ? 

The SDK has two design principles:
======================================
1. Enough features to be worth using
   but few enough primitives to make 
   it quick to learn
2. Works great out of the box
	Here are the main features 
		of the SDK
1) Agent Loop : Built-in agent loop 
   that handles calling tools, sending 
   results to the LLM, and looping until 
   the LLM is done.
2) Python-First : Use built-in language
   features to orchestrate and chain 
   agents, rather than needing to learn 
   new abstractions.
