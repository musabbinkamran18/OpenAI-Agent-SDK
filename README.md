# OpenAI-Agent-SDK

Agent SDK 
Diving In Source Code of Agent SDK
======================================

When Java came we know it catch success
it was a small language and people can
learn it ummm 15 - 30 days max. This same
goes for OpenAI SDK. Hopefully SDK is not
destroyed becuz Java was. Now lets not 
talk and jump to main work.
======================================

# Why use the Agent SDK ? 

# The SDK has two design principles:
======================================
# 1. Enough features to be worth using
#   but few enough primitives to make 
#   it quick to learn
# 2. Works great out of the box
 Here are the main features 
of the SDK
# 1) Agent Loop : Built-in agent loop 
  # that handles calling tools, sending 
  # results to the LLM, and looping until 
 #  the LLM is done.
# 2) Python-First : 
Use built-in language
features to orchestrate and chain 
agents, rather than needing to learn 
new abstractions.
