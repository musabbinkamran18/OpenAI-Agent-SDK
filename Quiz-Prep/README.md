- Dynamic instructions

---

### üü† Evening (2 hours): Practice and Review
**Code:**  
Write a small script to create an agent that calls a tool (e.g., fetch weather data via API)

**Review:**  
Summarize:
- Agent loop
- Tools
- Handoffs
- Context objects

**Quiz Yourself:**  
Answer 5‚Äì10 questions:
- What is a context object?
- Difference between `Runner.run_sync()` and streaming?
